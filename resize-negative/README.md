# MRAID-3.0-Compliance-Ads

## Resize negative tests

Tests check that `'error'` event is generated by MRAID SDK when calling `resize()` or `setResizeProperties()` should lead to an error event according to MRAID spec.

### Test cases

- Call `resize()` without calling `setResizeProperties()` before that
- Change state to `expanded`. Call resize. Resize is not supported in `expanded` state
- Set wrong resize properties:
  - pass undefined / no object to `setResizeProperties`
  - pass empty object to `setResizeProperties`
  - pass wrong values of resize properties to to `setResizeProperties`
- Set resize properties so that an ad is off screen, but `allowOffscreen` is `false` or not set
- Set resize properties that make ad too small (should be at least 50x50 on screen)
- Set resize properties that shift close button region off screen
  - `offsetX`
  - `offsetY`
  - `offsetX` and `offsetY`
  - `width`
