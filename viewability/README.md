# MRAID 3.0 Viewability Compliance Ad

This sample ad allows a user to track the exposed percentage values that a MRAID 3.0 SDK returns over time.

The data is presented as a histogram with the vertical axis representing the exposedPercentage value.

Each node on the horizontal axis represents a single exposureChange event.

## Getting Started

Clone this repository to your development environment and run the markup in ad.html an ad webview on the target SDK.

Note: this ad requires at least 100px of vertical space so that the lines of the chart can render legibly.

### Demo

Open mockTester.html in a browser to see a demonstration of what the output should look like under happy path conditions.
